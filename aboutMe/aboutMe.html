            <p>Me and my brother organized a fun activity with high school and university students which aimed for self discovery and goal setting through creative art. The participants had the opportunity to express ourselves through painting, coloring, making vision boards, and music. Together we discussed and shared our experiences and had a session on how to create SMART Goals.</p>

            <h4>Permet, Kelcyre Albania</h4>
            <h5>August 2021</h5>
            <p>A key issue I care about is gender equality. In June 2019, I took the first step of dealing with this problem by spreading awareness through a Gender Equality Workshop I organized, sharing everything that I had learned on The IDEAL 2021 Workshop. Two years later, after gaining more resources and funding from the BridgingBackground Program, I collaborated with a student from my hometown organizing a Girl Empowerment Workshop in two different towns in order to have a bigger impact in the community. I am particularly proud of this initiative, as it allowed me to empower girls by sharing success stories of women from our own community, inspiring them to pursue their own goals. </p>

            <h3>Fact-Checking Online Workshop </h3>
            <h4>online</h4>
            <h5>12 December 2020</h5>
            <p>I teamed up with a student from Albania and another from Mali to organize an online fact-checking workshop. The program attracted 35 participants from countries including Albania, Mali, Israel, Palestine, and Turkey. We led participants through a general overview of news literacy followed by an exploration of information neighborhoods, which include news, opinion, propaganda, and disinformation, and how to distinguish between them.</p>
